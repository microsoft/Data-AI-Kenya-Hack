# Setting Up Microsoft Fabric Capacity with an Azure Trial

Microsoft Fabric is a cloud-based platform that offers various services and experiences for different analytical scenarios, such as data engineering, data science, real-time analytics, and business intelligence. Microsoft Fabric is built on a foundation of Software as a Service (SaaS), which means that users do not have to worry about the underlying infrastructure or management of the services. Instead, they can focus on creating and consuming insights from their data.

Microsoft Fabric brings together the best of Microsoftâ€™s existing analytics products, such as Power BI, Azure Data Factory, and Azure Synapse, into a single unified environment. Users can easily access and reuse all the data and assets across these products and enjoy familiar, easy-to-learn shared experiences. Microsoft Fabric also provides centralized administration and governance for all the services, ensuring data security, privacy, and compliance.

This guide will walk you through the steps to set up Microsoft Fabric Capacity with an Azure trial. By following these steps, you will be able to create a Fabric Capacity in Azure, which is essential for using Fabric's data processing features. Additionally, you will need a Microsoft 365 or Office 365 trial account to access Microsoft Fabric. The guide will also provide instructions on how to avoid unexpected charges by pausing or deleting the Fabric Capacity and canceling the Azure and Office 365 trials.

>**Note:** This guide may seem long and involving many steps, but this is because we are setting a Microsoft 365 tenant, and an Azure Subscription before creating the Fabric Capacity. In an ideal scenario your IT team would have already set up the Microsoft 365 tenant and Azure subscription for you and the  sign up to Microsoft Fabric would only take less than 5 minutes.
>If you already have a Fabric Capacity ypu can skip the entire sign up process and go straight to creating a new workspace in Microsoft Fabric. If you have a Microsoft 365 or Office 365 account, you can skip the first part of this guide and go directly to signing up for Microsoft Fabric and creating a Fabric Capacity in Azure.

## **Part 1: Sign Up for an Office 365 Trial**  

Before using **Microsoft Fabric**, you need an **Office 365 trial account** because Fabric requires a **Microsoft 365 tenant** to work.  If you already have a Microsoft 365 or Office 365 account, you can skip this step.

1. Open this link: **[Microsoft 365 Enterprise Plans](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/enterprise/office365-plans-and-pricing)**.  
1. Choose **"Office 365 E1"** (or **E3/E5**) and click **"Try for free"**.  
1. Follow the setup prompts:  
   - Use a **personal email (not a work or school email)** to register.  
   - Click **Next**, then select **"Set up account"** to create your **Microsoft 365 tenant**.  

    >**Note:** This process will require providing a payment method and will enable recurring billing after 30 days (which can be disabled with additional steps).  This will be mentioned during the registration process:
1. Once the account is created, Microsoft will generate a new username with a **.onmicrosoft.com** domain.  
   - Example: `yourname@yourcompany.onmicrosoft.com`  
1. After setup, click **"Start using Office 365 E1 (No Teams) - Trial"** to access the **Microsoft 365 Admin Center**.  

>**Note:**  This trial lasts **one month**, so cancel before it expires to **avoid charges**.

Upon activation, you can disable the recurring billing manually by logging into [https://admin.microsoft.com](https://admin.microsoft.com/ ) with the newly created organizational account, then navigate to Billing => Your Products and select the 3 dots next to the newly created Office 365 subscription.  From there you can turn off recurring billing as shown:
