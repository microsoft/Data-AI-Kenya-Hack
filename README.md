For a great example of a community developed solution that demonstrates a high-quality submission for this Hackathon, check out:

[PIInovators: Grand Prize winner for the “HackTogether: The Microsoft Fabric Global AI Hack”](https://github.com/esddata/piinovators.git)

This solution is a great example because it:

- Solves a real-world problem in a novel way using Microsoft Fabric and Azure AI
- Is shared in a public GitHub repository
- Has a clear documentation and instructions on how to reproduce the solution
- Has a clear [video](https://youtu.be/vvfRFNgo-PI?si=12vrXbARz2a_fbyl) demonstration of the solution
